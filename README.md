# windows-batch-scripts
Some useful bat, cmd and powershell scripts to do things like, start subgit shared daemon installed via my scoop repository, or to make it easy to kill processes by name. 
For easy access to these commands, simply clone this repository and then add the directory to your system path, eg: 

```
# Add it to your system-wide path
SetX /m PATH "%USERPROFILE\Documents\windows-batch-scripts;%PATH%"
# Or, remove the /m before PATH in the command above to set the path just for your user account
```
